# Bobby1968AngularExamProject

This is my final project to the course Angular - july 2021 in SoftUni.
Defence date: 28.08.2021

The current project is a short version of my own active working MS Access project that I use in my work as a lawyer.

The project uses Angular as a front-end framework to implement partially database for civil court cases of lawyer 
 for "Toploficatia Ruse" AD. Back-End is realized with Backendless.com

UserAuthentication is implemented in "users" folder, "clients" folder is the location of components that implement logic about clients.

All pictures are stored in Azure blob storage.
